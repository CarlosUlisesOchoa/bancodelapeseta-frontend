## Welcome to 'Banco De La Peseta' üè¶

We are thrilled that you are interested in contributing to 'Banco De La Peseta', a project made by and for the community! This document is designed to guide you through the contribution process in a simple and transparent manner. It's important to mention that this project is developed with Ionic.

### First Steps üöÄ

* **Familiarize yourself with the stack and project structure**: Review how the files and folders are organized to facilitate locating what you need and knowing where to add your changes.

* **Set up your development environment**: We use `npm`, the default package manager for Node.js. Make sure you have it installed on your system.

### How to Contribute üõ†

#### 1. Prepare Your Environment

- **Fork the repository**: Click on "Fork" at the top right of the GitHub page. This will allow you to work on your own copy of the project.
- **Clone your fork to your local machine**: Execute the command: `git clone <URL of your account's fork>` to clone the repository.
- **Add the original repository as a remote**: Execute the command: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/rayexbomx/bancodelapeseta-frontend.git`.
- **Switch to the `dev` branch**: Execute the command: `git checkout dev` to switch to the development branch.
- **Install the dependencies**: In the project directory, run `npm install`.

#### 2. Work on Your Changes

- **First and foremost, update your fork**: Synchronize your fork with the original repository (upstream). To do this, first make sure you are on the `dev` branch, execute the command: `git checkout dev && git fetch upstream` and then execute: `git merge upstream/dev` to merge the changes from the original repository into your local `dev` branch.

- **Create a new branch for your changes**: Execute the command: `git checkout -b <name-of-your-branch>` to start working. (For example, "git checkout -b feature/new-footer").

- **Develop and test your changes**: Implement your improvements and run `npm start` to test them on `http://localhost:4200`.

#### 3. Prevent Branch Conflicts

Before publishing your changes, it's crucial to re-sync your local 'dev' branch. This will ensure that your changes do not conflict with the changes of other contributors. Follow these steps to prevent conflicts:

* Make sure your branch is clean with `git status` and that you have no pending changes to commit.
* Switch to the dev branch with `git checkout dev`.
* Bring the latest changes from the original remote repository with `git pull upstream dev`.
* Switch back to your branch with `git checkout <name-of-your-branch>`.
* Update your branch with the changes you just brought in. Use: `git merge dev`.
* Resolve any conflicts that may arise. If you have doubts, do not hesitate to ask.
* Run `npm ci` and `npm run build`. There should be no errors.
* Take a final look at your changes with `npm start` and verify that everything is still working correctly.

#### 4. Submit Your Changes

- **Commit and push your changes**: Use clear and descriptive messages for your commits. Then, push to your fork with `git push origin <name-of-your-branch>`.
- **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Clearly describe your changes and their importance in the PR.

### Best Practices üåü

- **Check open issues and PRs** before starting your work to avoid duplications.
- **Keep your commits clean** and follow the project's code conventions.
- **Actively participate** in the discussions of your PRs to integrate feedback and suggestions.
